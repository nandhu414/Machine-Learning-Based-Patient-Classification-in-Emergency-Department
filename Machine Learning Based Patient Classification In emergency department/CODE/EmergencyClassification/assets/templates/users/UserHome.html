                            <h2>Machine Learning <strong> Based Patient</strong> Classification In Emergency Department</h2>
                            <p>
                                This work contains the classification of patients
in an Emergency Department in a hospital according to their
critical conditions. Machine learning can be applied based on the
patient’s condition to quickly determine if the patient requires
urgent medical intervention from the clinicians or not. Basic vital
signs like Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure
(DBP), Respiratory Rate (RR), Oxygen saturation (SPO2), Random
Blood Sugar (RBS), Temperature, Pulse Rate (PR) are used
as the input for the patients’ risk level identification. High-risk
or non-risk categories are considered as the output for patient
classification. Basic machine learning techniques such as LR,
Gaussian NB, SVM, KNN and DT are used for the classification.
Precision, recall, and F1-score are considered for the evaluation.
The decision tree gives best F1-score of 77.67 for the risk level
classification of the imbalanced dataset.
